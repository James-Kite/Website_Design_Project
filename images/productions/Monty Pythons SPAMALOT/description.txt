Very loosely based on the 1975 film Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Spamalot tells the tale of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table and their quest to find the fabled relic. 

It features a chorus line of dancing divas (with serfs), flatulent Frenchmen, killer rabbits and a legless knight.
